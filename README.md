# Resonance Detection

hello hadi
This script reads a power spectra and finds the different peaks in the measurement, fits each to a Lorentzian function and computes from it the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the peak. Also it measures the distance between peaks and computes the Frequency Shift between REsonances (FSR). The inputs to the function are the power spectra, as a matrix with to vector columns, one with the wavelength and the other one with the power in dBm.
