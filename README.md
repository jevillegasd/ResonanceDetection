# Spectral Measurements 
Spectral Measurements is a matlab based application to interface with Keysight/Agilent Lightwave Measurement Systems. It supports the standard configuration of such systems that uses a variable laser source combined with a optical power sensor to allow carrying spectral sweeps, typical of optical characterization of photonic devices.
